This folder contains two folders: English and Polish, what means that in English folder are projects which are commented in English, and in Polish folder are projects which are commented in Polish. Projects are different in those folders. The main topics of the projects: Data Visualization with elements of Data Science, Machine Learning (main parts are Supervised Learning and Deep Learning).

I did some courses on Udemy and practical projects were part of the courses. The English folder contains my own solutions for these projects.

The Polish folder contains projects that were part of the offset of some subjects from studies at the university. Projects topics are related to the subject, but the projects and decisions themselves are my own.

All Jupyter Notebooks (*.ipynb) can be open directly on github.
